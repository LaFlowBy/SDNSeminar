abstract = {As a result of the development of internet and ICT (information-centric technology) advances including mobile, cloud, social networking, big data, multimedia and the tendency towards digital society, the management and configuration of them have become highly complex, challenging and time consuming. Also, access to high bandwidth, extendibility and dynamic management are of critical significance, especially when network devices are vertically integrated. Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers' attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined. The investigation and overview of SDN reported in this paper might be used by the interested future researchers to better understand and apply SDN in real-life applications.}

    abstract = { The exponential growth of devices connected to the network has resulted in the development of new IoT applications and on-line services. However, these advances are limited by the rigidity of the current network infrastructure, in which the administrator has to implement high-level network policies adapting and configuring protocols manually and usually through a command line interface (CLI). At this point, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) appears as a viable alternative network architecture that allows for programming the network and opening the possibility of creating new services and more efficient applications to cover the actual requirements. In this paper, we describe this new technology and analyze its opportunities in the development of IoT applications. Similarly, we present the first applications and projects based on this technology. Finally, we discuss the issues and challenges in its implementation. }

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) and Software Defined Network (SDN) are two emerging technologies. The IoT aims to connect objects over the Internet and the SDN provides orchestration for network management by decoupling the control plane and the data plane. The number of connected objects is in billions, and its management and control is a complex task for a large distributed network. The SDN provides flexibility and programmability in the IoT network without troubling underlying architecture of existing implementations. In this paper, we study different IoT application and domains, and the generalized IoT-SDN solutions over the period of 2012-2016. Furthermore, this paper provides a critical view of the IoT and the SDN technologies, current trends in research and the futuristic contributing factors. A comparative analysis of the existing solutions of SDN-based IoT implementations provides an easy and concise view of the emerging trends.},

abstract = {IoT networks can provide many benefits and opportunities, although their implementation poses challenges. Cloud-only storage of IoT data would be very costly and time-consuming. In this paper, a new scheme is proposed for caching IoT content on the edge with SDN-based processing capability. The proposed scheme considers a global SDN controller, which coordinates cache decisions across the entire IoT network. The Moth-Flame Optimization-Cluster Head Selection (MFO-CHS) algorithm is used to cluster devices where the selected cluster heads send the IoT data to the edge nodes for caching. In addition, by utilizing edge caching capabilities and using MFO to select and cache the appropriate contents on edge nodes, the proposed Moth-Flame Optimization-Edge Caching (MFO-EC) algorithm can provide data with lower latency on upcoming requests. Caching can also help ensure reliability and availability since intermittent connections and power limitations affect IoT devices. Caching decisions regarding IoT characteristics are not made intelligently in the default caching scheme for maximizing device longevity and managing the possibility that content producers may become unreachable. This scheme considers several metrics, and the proposed moth-flame optimization (MFO) algorithms, MFO-CHS, and MFO-EC algorithms, which are nature-inspired paradigms for the edge caching problem called “MFO-SDN-EC”, Moth-Flame Optimization-Software-defined Networking -Edge Caching, are used to select the best options regarding considered criteria and improve the QoS in the SDN based IoT environment. Based on simulations, our proposed caching method can reduce energy consumption by 45\%, decrease the average response time by 49\%, and also increase cache-hit rates. Furthermore, our results demonstrate our algorithm’s superiority over several current approaches in terms of assessment measures.},
